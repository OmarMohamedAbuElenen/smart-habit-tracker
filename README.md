## Running the Application

* Frontend is accessible at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend API is accessible at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Upcoming Work

1. Implement frontend pages for managing habits and marking completion

2. Enhance user account functionality, including logout feature

3. Introduce state management in the frontend (e.g., Redux or Context API)

4. Support pagination for habit listings

5. Add linters and formatters for both backend (e.g., flake8, black) and frontend (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)

6. Expand habits functionality with additional filters and analytics
